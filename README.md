# Building the application for development

The fastest and easiest way to get started developing with too-many-cells-interactive is with Docker and Docker Compose. If you don't already have them on your system, please consult the [relevant install guides](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

To build the application for development, you will need to provision the Docker containers, compile the Typescript, and mount your `cluster_tree.json` and `labels.csv` files into the node server's `static/files` directory. To do so, you may simply copy them into `<project-root>/node/static/files`, since the the [development docker-compose](docker-compose.yaml) file mounts the host's entire `node` directory into the container.
  - the Docker configuration for development can be found in [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml). Unlike the "production" configuration, the development setup splits the javascript code into front-end (React) and back-end (Node) containers. By default, the React application will listen on port 1212. You can change this value by creating an `.env` file and entering your own value for `REACT_PORT`. There is a sample `.env` file called `.env.sample` that can serve as a basis. Both the node and react containers are configured to recompile whenever there is a code change.
  - You need to perform the feature provisioning process just once for a given dataset. After the features are in the database and files moved into the `/node/static/files` directory, `docker-compose up` is sufficient to bring up the application. If you would like to import a new set of features, the easiest way to do so is to rerun the `start-and-load.sh` script, which will drop your previous data from the PostgreSQL database and import new data. Your dev application will use this same data the next time you bring it up with `docker-compose up`.
